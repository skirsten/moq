//! Lossy latest-value JSON publishing over [`moq-net`](moq_net) tracks.
//!
//! One JSON value updated over time, for consumers that only care about the current state (a
//! catalog, a status document). This mode is **lossy** by design: a consumer yields only the
//! most recent value. A late joiner (or a consumer that falls behind) jumps straight to the
//! newest group and collapses any buffered backlog into a single yield, and older groups are
//! dropped entirely. Intermediate updates are never replayed. For an ordered log where every
//! record is preserved, use [`stream`](crate::stream) instead.
//!
//! On the wire the value is published as a series of groups, where each group is
//! self-contained: its first frame is a full snapshot and any following frames are
//! [RFC 7396](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7396.html) JSON Merge Patch deltas applied in
//! order. A consumer jumps to the newest group, reads the snapshot, and applies the deltas, so
//! a late joiner never needs older groups.
//!
//! Deltas are controlled by [`ProducerConfig::delta_ratio`]. A ratio of `0` disables them, so every
//! change is a fresh snapshot group, matching a plain "one JSON blob per group" track.
