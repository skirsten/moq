//! RTMP server: accept connections, and hand each pending request to the caller
//! as a [`Request`] to authorize.
//!
//! [`Server::accept`] runs the RTMP handshake and the connect command exchange
//! for each TCP connection (many concurrently, so a slow client doesn't block
//! others), then yields a [`Request`] once the client issues its `publish` or
//! `play` command. The caller inspects the app and stream key, makes an
//! authorization decision, and either:
//!
//! - **[`Request::Publish`]**: [`Publish::accept`] (ingest into an origin at a
//!   path) or [`Publish::reject`]. This is the contribution path (OBS, ffmpeg).
//! - **[`Request::Play`]**: [`Play::accept`] (serve a broadcast from an origin
//!   down to the player) or [`Play::reject`]. This is the egress path: a player
//!   (VLC, ffplay, mpv) pulls `rtmp://host/<app>/<key>` and we stream it back.
//!
//! This mirrors `moq-native`'s `Server` / `Request`, so the gateway stays
//! unopinionated about auth: the embedder (e.g. a relay verifying the stream key
//! as a JWT) owns that policy.
//!
//! RTMPS (RTMP over TLS): [`Server::with_tls`] makes the listener terminate TLS
//! before the RTMP handshake, so `rtmps://` clients work with no other change.
//! If you'd rather own the transport (custom TLS, a non-TCP socket, a test
//! pipe), accept the connection and complete any handshake yourself, then hand
//! the established stream to [`accept_stream`]; everything here is generic over
//! the [`Stream`] trait.
