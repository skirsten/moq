//! SRT server: accept connections, and hand each pending request to the caller
//! as a [`Request`] to authorize.
//!
//! [`Server::accept`] yields a [`Request`] for each incoming SRT connection,
//! before the handshake is finalized, classified by its stream-id `m=` mode into
//! one of two directions. The caller inspects [`Request::resource`] /
//! [`Request::stream_id`], makes an authorization decision, and either:
//!
//! - **[`Request::Publish`]**: [`Publish::accept`] (ingest the connection's
//!   MPEG-TS into an origin at a path) or [`Publish::reject`]. This is the
//!   contribution path (OBS, ffmpeg).
//! - **[`Request::Subscribe`]**: [`Subscribe::accept`] (re-mux a broadcast from
//!   an origin back to MPEG-TS and stream it down to the caller) or
//!   [`Subscribe::reject`]. This is the egress path: a player (VLC, ffmpeg) pulls
//!   `srt://host:port?streamid=#!::r=<broadcast>,m=request`.
//!
//! This mirrors `moq-native`'s `Server` / `Request`, so the gateway stays
//! unopinionated about auth: the embedder (e.g. a relay verifying the stream id
//! as a JWT) owns that policy. For the unauthenticated convenience that accepts
//! everything and routes by prefix, use [`crate::run`].
