//! Generic stats publishing for moq-net sessions.
//!
//! [`Stats`] aggregates per-broadcast counter bumps for traffic this relay
//! node is handling and publishes them on a single `<prefix>/node/<node>`
//! broadcast (or `<prefix>/node` when no node is configured). The broadcast
//! carries four tracks, one per `(tier, role)` pair:
//!
//! * `publisher.json`           : external (e.g. customer) egress
//! * `subscriber.json`          : external ingress
//! * `internal/publisher.json`  : internal (e.g. mTLS cluster peer) egress
//! * `internal/subscriber.json` : internal ingress
//!
//! Each frame is a JSON object mapping broadcast path to a cumulative
//! counter snapshot. Tier, role, and node are implied by the track and
//! broadcast paths, so they aren't repeated inside the frame. An entry
//! appears in the frame for a given `(tier, role)` on any tick where the
//! broadcast is live (any open counter still exceeds its `*_closed`
//! counterpart, so a subscription could begin at any moment) or its
//! snapshot changed since the previous tick. Once every counter equals its
//! `*_closed` counterpart no traffic can flow, so the entry is dropped. A
//! downstream aggregator computes rates from successive cumulative
//! snapshots and slices the data however a dashboard wants.
//!
//! Per-snapshot semantics:
//!
//! * `announced` / `announced_closed`: cumulative count of broadcast
//!   announce/unannounce events on this `(tier, role)`. Bumped on every
//!   `publisher()` / `subscriber()` guard creation and drop.
//! * `broadcasts` / `broadcasts_closed`: derived by the snapshot task from
//!   subscription transitions. `broadcasts` bumps each tick the slot
//!   transitions from "no active subs" to "one or more active subs" (or
//!   when subs flickered through 0 within a tick). `broadcasts_closed`
//!   bumps on the reverse transition. Use these for "active broadcasts"
//!   billing/UI metrics; use `announced` if you want all broadcasts ever
//!   seen.
//! * `subscriptions` / `subscriptions_closed`: cumulative count of
//!   track-level subscription guards opened/dropped.
//! * `bytes` / `frames` / `groups`: cumulative payload counters bumped from
//!   the lite session loops.
//!
//! Counters are strictly monotonic (only `fetch_add`); a counter going
//! backwards across snapshots means the underlying entry was garbage
//! collected and re-created. Downstream consumers should treat decreases
//! as a fresh session segment, summing across resets when computing
//! lifetime totals.
//!
//! A caller hands each session a tier-scoped [`StatsHandle`] (built from the
//! single shared [`Stats`] via [`Stats::tier`]) which determines which counter
//! set its bumps land in. Multiple relays in the same cluster origin can
//! coexist by giving each one a distinct `<node>` suffix on the advertised
//! path. The suffix itself may be multi-segment (e.g. `sjc/1`, `sjc/2`) so a
//! region with multiple hosts can nest under a shared region key without
//! colliding.
//!
//! # Disabled stats
//!
//! A [`StatsConfig`] with no origin (the default) builds a no-op aggregator:
//! all counter bumps are silently dropped, no snapshot task spawns, and no
//! broadcast is published. [`Stats::default`] / [`StatsHandle::default`]
//! return one, so call sites can hold a [`StatsHandle`] unconditionally
//! instead of threading an `Option`.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! When the config has an origin, [`Stats::new`] spawns the snapshot task
//! immediately, publishes the stats broadcast, and ticks at the configured
//! interval, writing a frame per (tier, role) track. The broadcast stays
//! announced for the lifetime of the [`Stats`] aggregator, even while idle
//! (frames just go to `{}`). The task exits when the last [`Stats`] clone is
//! dropped (the task holds only a `Weak` to the shared state).
//!
//! # Idle frame skipping
//!
//! On each tick the task compares the just-built per-(tier, role) JSON payload
//! against the last one it emitted and writes a frame only when something
//! changed. New subscribers still pick up a baseline immediately because
//! track-latest semantics retain the most recent emitted frame.
//!
//! # Snapshot atomicity
//!
//! Each [`Counters`] snapshot reads `*_closed` atomics (with `Acquire`)
//! before their open counterparts (with `Relaxed`). The matching close
//! bumps in the RAII guards' `Drop` impls use `Release`. With this
//! pairing the snapshot always satisfies `open >= closed` even on
//! weakly-ordered architectures (ARM, POWER): the `Acquire` load of
//! close synchronizes-with the `Release` bump that produced the
//! observed value, making every write that happened-before that close
//! (including the matching open bump on whichever thread opened the
//! guard) visible to the snapshot thread. Open / payload counters can
//! then stay `Relaxed` because the visibility comes for free through
//! the close pairing. The cost is a slight upward bias on the open
//! counts when a bump lands between the two loads, which never produces
//! a logically impossible (`closed > open`) snapshot for downstream.
//!
//! # Cycles
//!
//! Calling [`StatsHandle::broadcast`] for a path under the configured
//! top-level prefix returns an empty handle whose bumps no-op. This breaks
//! the feedback loop where serving a `<top-prefix>/...` broadcast would
//! itself generate more stats traffic.
