//! Container formats.
//!
//! A container decides how a media frame is laid out inside a moq-lite
//! frame: framing overhead, whether multiple samples can share one moq
//! frame, and whether the same encoding doubles as a file format on disk.
//!
//! Each submodule implements one format. The wire-level ones implement
//! the [`Container`] trait, so [`Producer<C>`] and [`Consumer<C>`] can
//! be generic over the choice. The catalog announces a container per
//! track; [`catalog::hang::Container`](crate::catalog::hang::Container)
//! dispatches the right implementation at runtime.
