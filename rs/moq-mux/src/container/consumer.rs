/// `Consumer` wraps a [`moq_net::TrackConsumer`] and a [`Container`]
/// format implementation, typically
/// [`catalog::hang::Container`](crate::catalog::hang::Container). Yields
/// decoded frames via [`read`](Self::read).
///
/// ## Ordering & latency skipping
///
/// Groups can arrive on the wire out of order. The consumer always reads frames *within*
/// a group in arrival order, but across groups it advances by sequence number, skipping
/// stalled or missing groups when the difference between the oldest pending timestamp
/// and the newest available timestamp exceeds the configured latency. With the default
/// latency of zero, the consumer skips aggressively. Any group that has a newer
/// alternative is dropped. With a non-zero latency, slow groups are tolerated up to that
/// budget before being skipped.
///
/// A stalled group is also skipped early, regardless of the latency budget, once it has
/// presented up to where the next group begins. CMAF frames carry a per-sample duration,
/// so a group whose most recent frame ends (timestamp + duration) at or past the next
/// group's first timestamp has nothing left worth waiting for. Containers without a
/// duration report zero, which disables this check and falls back to the latency budget.
///
/// Set the latency with [`with_latency`](Self::with_latency).
///
/// ## Timeline rewinds
///
/// If a newer group's timestamps jump backwards past the live edge, the publisher is
/// reneging the buffered tail (e.g. a voice agent interrupted mid-utterance). The consumer
/// drops the reneged groups and resumes at the rewound timeline. This is always on.
