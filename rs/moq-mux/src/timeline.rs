//! Timeline publish/subscribe.
//!
//! A timeline is one media track's group index: one [`hang::timeline::Record`] per group,
//! appended the moment the group opens, mapping a group sequence to the group's start
//! timestamp. A consumer can answer "which group covers time T" and "where is the live edge"
//! from a few bytes per group without subscribing to media, the primitive a playlist server
//! (HLS/DASH), a seek bar, or a recorder index needs.
//!
//! One timeline track per media track (audio and video groups have different durations, so a
//! single broadcast-wide timeline can't describe both). The write side splits by role:
//!
//! - [`Producer`] owns the track and its catalog metadata: the [`section`](Producer::section)
//!   advertised in the rendition's config and the [`set_wall`](Producer::set_wall) anchor. The
//!   [`catalog::Producer`](crate::catalog::Producer) creates and owns one per rendition; it is not
//!   `Clone`, so a timeline is bound to its one media track.
//! - `Recorder` is the move-only handle the media track records group opens through, minted 1:1
//!   by the catalog into the rendition's [`container::Producer`](crate::container::Producer) (see
//!   [`catalog::Producer::media_producer`](crate::catalog::Producer::media_producer)). Being
//!   move-only, it can't be shared with a second track, and it owns its throttle cursor outright.
//!
//! On the read side, [`Consumer::subscribe`] reads a timeline straight from its
//! [`hang::catalog::Timeline`] section (so the track name and timescale come from the catalog and
//! can't be mismatched) and yields decoded [`Entry`]s with a real [`Timestamp`].
//!
//! On the wire the track is a DEFLATE-compressed [`moq_json::stream`] (a single group, one record
//! per frame; see [`hang::timeline`] for the record schema).
//!
//! Recording is throttled to a [`granularity`](Producer::with_granularity) (default
//! [`DEFAULT_GRANULARITY`], one second): at most one record per that much media time. Video
//! keyframes are already a granularity or more apart, so every group is indexed; short audio groups
//! are thinned out. A consumer that lands between two records extrapolates the group number
//! (sequences are contiguous) or fetches to fill the gap.
