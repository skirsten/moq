//! WebRTC ↔ MoQ gateway.
//!
//! Bridges WHIP (RFC 9725) and WHEP between WebRTC peers and
//! [`moq_net`] broadcasts. The crate is split along two orthogonal axes
//! so all four combinations can land independently:
//!
//! | | RTP-in (ingest into MoQ) | RTP-out (egress from MoQ) |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | HTTP server | [`Server::publish_router`] (WHIP server) | [`Server::subscribe_router`] (WHEP server) |
//! | HTTP client | [`Client::subscribe`] (WHEP client) | [`Client::publish`] (WHIP client) |
//!
//! The two HTTP-client paths and the two HTTP-server paths share a single
//! [`session::Session`] driver and the same per-codec adapters in [`codec`];
//! the per-direction split lives in [`session::MediaSink`] (ingest) /
//! [`egress::EgressSource`] (egress).
//!
//! ## Embedding
//!
//! Depend on this crate with `default-features = false` to embed the gateway
//! in another process: build a [`Server`] over your own
//! [`OriginProducer`](moq_net::OriginProducer) /
//! [`OriginConsumer`](moq_net::OriginConsumer) and merge
//! [`Server::publish_router`] / [`Server::subscribe_router`] into your own axum
//! app, or dial out with [`Client`]. That lean build skips the standalone
//! binary's deps (axum-server, clap, moq-native, rustls, sd-notify, tower-http),
//! which the `server` feature (on by default) pulls back in for the `moq-rtc`
//! binary.
//!
//! The bundled routers are unauthenticated: they derive the broadcast name from
//! the request path. To own the HTTP route and authorize requests yourself
//! (resolving the broadcast name from a verified token), skip the routers and
//! call [`whip::accept`] (ingest) / [`whep::accept`] (egress) from your own
//! handler.
//!
//! ## Bitstream gotcha
//!
//! The WebRTC ↔ MoQ shape conversion for H.264 is handled by `moq-mux`'s
//! `Avc3` importer: str0m hands us Annex-B (start-code NALs with inline
//! SPS/PPS) and that's exactly what the importer wants, so no extra
//! transform is needed in the gateway. Opus, VP8, and VP9 pass through.
