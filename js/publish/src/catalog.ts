 * A stable catalog producer that fans out to on-demand subscription tracks.
 *
 * Unlike a raw track producer, this exists independently of any subscription: edit it at any time
 * with {@link mutate}, and each subscriber (including a relay that reconnects) is seeded with the
 * current catalog before receiving updates. Independent owners (the base `video`/`audio` and an
 * application's own sections, e.g. `scte35`) each edit only their own keys, so their sections
 * compose instead of clobbering one another.
