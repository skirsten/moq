 * Native-JS (non-browser) smoke subscriber: run the workspace `@moq/net` +

 * `@moq/web-transport` polyfill (a prebuilt NAPI QUIC/HTTP3 addon, the one piece
 * that comes from npm rather than this checkout). Runs under both node and bun.
 * Connect, find the video track in the .hang catalog, subscribe, and exit 0 as
 * soon as a non-empty frame arrives (1 on timeout). Subscribe-only: publishing
 * media needs a WebCodecs encoder a native JS runtime lacks.
