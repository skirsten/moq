# moq-relay
A server that routes broadcasts between publishers and subscribers, performing caching, deduplication, and fan-out.

## Overview

`moq-relay` is designed to run in datacenters, relaying media across multiple hops to improve quality of service and enable massive scale.

**Features:**
- Fan-out to multiple subscribers
- Caching and deduplication
- Cross-region clustering
- JWT-based authentication
- HTTP debugging endpoints

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moq-dev/moq
cd moq
cargo build --release --bin moq-relay
```

The binary will be in `target/release/moq-relay`.

### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install moq-relay
```

### Using Nix

```bash
# Run directly
nix run github:moq-dev/moq#moq-relay

# Or build and find the binary in ./result/bin/
nix build github:moq-dev/moq#moq-relay
```

### Using Docker

```bash
docker pull kixelated/moq-relay
docker run -p 4443:4443/udp -v "$(pwd)/relay.toml:/app/relay.toml:ro" kixelated/moq-relay -- --config /app/relay.toml
```

Multi-arch images (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`) are published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kixelated/moq-relay).

## Configuration

Create a `relay.toml` configuration file:

```toml
[server]
bind = "[::]:4443"  # Listen on all interfaces, port 4443

[tls]
cert = "/path/to/cert.pem"  # TLS certificate
key = "/path/to/key.pem"    # TLS private key

[auth]
public = "anon"     # Allow anonymous access to anon/**
key = "root.jwk"    # JWT key for authenticated paths
```

See [dev.toml](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/blob/main/rs/moq-relay/cfg/dev.toml) for a complete example.

## Running

```bash
moq-relay --config relay.toml
```

Or with the config path as the only argument:

```bash
moq-relay relay.toml
```

## HTTP Endpoints

The relay exposes HTTP/HTTPS endpoints for debugging, health checks, and late-join. See [HTTP](/app/relay/http) for details.

## TLS Setup

The relay requires TLS certificates. Use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/):

```bash
# Install certbot
sudo apt install certbot  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install certbot      # macOS

# Generate certificate
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d relay.example.com
```

Update `relay.toml`:

```toml
[tls]
cert = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/relay.example.com/fullchain.pem"
key = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/relay.example.com/privkey.pem"
```

## Monitoring

### Logging

Set log level via environment variable:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info moq-relay relay.toml
RUST_LOG=debug moq-relay relay.toml
RUST_LOG=moq_relay=trace moq-relay relay.toml
```

### Metrics

Metrics (Prometheus format) are planned but not yet implemented.

Current visibility:
- Check logs for connection count
- Use [HTTP endpoints](/app/relay/http) for track inspection
- Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth)

## Performance

### Current Status

- **Single-threaded** - Quinn uses one UDP receive thread
- **In-memory caching** - Recent groups stored in RAM
- **Mesh clustering** - All relays connect to all others

### Scaling

- **Vertical** - Fast CPU matters more than core count
- **Horizontal** - Deploy multiple relays in different regions
- **Cluster size** - 3-5 nodes optimal with current implementation

### Future Improvements

- Multi-threaded UDP processing
- Tree-based clustering topology
- Improved memory management
- Metrics and observability

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Check what's using port 4443
lsof -i :4443

# Kill the process or use a different port
```

### Certificate Errors

Ensure:
- Certificate is valid and not expired
- Certificate matches domain name
- Private key has correct permissions
- Certificate includes full chain

### Connection Timeouts

Check:
- UDP port is open in firewall
- Cloud provider allows UDP traffic
- TLS certificate is valid
- Relay is actually running

## Next Steps

- Set up [Authentication](/app/relay/auth)
- Configure [Clustering](/app/relay/cluster)
- Deploy to [Production](/app/relay/prod)
- Use [moq-lite](/rs/crate/moq-lite) client library
- Build media apps with [hang](/rs/crate/hang)
