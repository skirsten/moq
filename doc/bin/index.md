# Applications

These are the applications you can run today.
Some are servers, some are command-line tools, and some are web apps.

## [moq-relay](/bin/relay/)

The relay server that routes broadcasts between publishers and subscribers.
This is the heart of any MoQ deployment that relies on fanout.
Run it yourself, or pay for an external service (ex. Cloudflare).

- [Configuration](/bin/relay/config) - TOML reference and examples
- [Authentication](/bin/relay/auth) - JWT-based access control
- [HTTP Endpoints](/bin/relay/http) - Debugging and diagnostics
- [Clustering](/bin/relay/cluster) - Multi-region deployment

## [moq-cli](/bin/cli)

A CLI for publishing to media streams.
Another tool does the encoding (ex. ffmpeg), making it easy to pipe any media into MoQ.

```bash
# Publish your webcam
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i "0" -f mpegts - | moq-cli publish --url https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast my-stream ts
```

## [moq-rtc](/bin/rtc)

A WebRTC <-> MoQ gateway. Speaks WHIP (publish) and WHEP (subscribe) in either
HTTP role, so it can accept incoming peers (OBS, browsers) or dial out to a
remote WebRTC server. Ingest and egress both work for H.264, VP8, VP9, and Opus.

## [moq-rtmp](/bin/rtmp)

An RTMP / enhanced-RTMP -> MoQ ingest gateway. Accepts RTMP from any encoder
(OBS, ffmpeg) and publishes it into MoQ, supporting H.264/HEVC/AV1/VP9 and
AAC/Opus/AC-3.

## [OBS Plugin](/bin/obs)

Real-time latency with the familiar OBS interface.
Supports both publishing and subscribing.

## [GStreamer Plugin](/bin/gstreamer)

Integrate MoQ into GStreamer pipelines for advanced media workflows.
Supports both publishing and subscribing.

## [Web Demo](/bin/web)

A demo web application showcasing MoQ in the browser.
Watch streams, publish from your camera, and explore the API.
